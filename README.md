**Chemprop** is a repository containing message passing neural networks for molecular property prediction. Chemprop has been successfully used in the following works:

- **A Deep Learning Approach to Antibiotic Discovery - Cell (2020):**  
  Chemprop was used to predict antibiotic activity against *E. coli*, leading to the discovery of Halicin, a novel antibiotic candidate. Model checkpoints are available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org).

- **Discovery of a structural class of antibiotics with explainable deep learning - Nature (2023):**  
  Identified a structural class of antibiotics selective against methicillin-resistant *S. aureus* (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci using ensembles of Chemprop models, and explained results using Chemprop's interpret method.

**DDI-GCN**, which utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and co-attention neural networks to identify DDIs and visualize substructures that may be associated with DDIs. Besides, DDI-GCN predicts DDI types that are related to DDI pharmacology.
